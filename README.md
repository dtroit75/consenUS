# consensUs

Welcome to your new consensUs project and to the internet computer development community. 

Description:
Explore the future of real estate development with our decentralized governance platform powered by Web3 technology. This innovative project introduces a secure and transparent solution tailored for the real estate industry, focusing on efficient decision-making through a decentralized voting system.

Key Features:

Blockchain-Powered Real Estate Transactions:
Leverage the security and immutability of blockchain technology for transparent and tamper-proof real estate transactions. Every step of the process is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring integrity and reducing fraud risks.

Decentralized Decision-Making:
Empower stakeholders in the real estate industry to actively participate in project governance. Our platform integrates a robust Web3-based voting system that enables transparent decision-making on key project milestones, promoting community engagement and consensus.

Smart Contracts for Construction Project Fulfillment:
Utilize smart contracts to automate and execute agreements within the construction process. Smart contracts facilitate secure and self-executing transactions, streamlining the fulfillment of construction projects and reducing the need for intermediaries.

Immutable Project Documentation:
Store critical project documentation and updates on a decentralized network, ensuring that information remains accessible, transparent, and unalterable over time. This feature enhances accountability and fosters trust among project stakeholders.

User-Friendly Interface:
Our platform provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the voting process and overall interaction with blockchain technology. Whether you're a developer, investor, or community member, our platform ensures a seamless experience.

How to Contribute:
Join us in shaping the future of decentralized real estate governance. Contribute to the development, report issues, or provide feedback. Together, let's revolutionize the way real estate projects are managed and fulfilled.

Embark on this Web3 journey with us, and let's build a more transparent, inclusive, and efficient real estate industry. Welcome to the decentralized future of real estate development! 🌐🏡🚀



If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd consensUs/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
